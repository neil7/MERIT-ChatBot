    {"input": "What is conjugate heat transfer analysis in Liquid Rocket Engine Systems (LPSC)", "reference": "Liquid fuel rocket engines employ several cooling techniques to maintain material temperatures within acceptable limits. The Vikas engine, for example, uses a combination of an ablative throat (Silica Phenolic) and film cooling. During the ablation process, the Silica Phenolic sacrifices itself by burning to char. Furthermore, pyrolyzed gases from within the ablative material generate a film cooling layer. A numerical tool that can estimate heat flux into the walls of rocket engines and simultaneously simulate such a cooling methodology as ablation, along with radiation, will go a long way in the design optimization of existing engines. The development of a validated conjugate heat transfer code to simulate the following is thus proposed: • Conjugate heat transfer analysis of combusted gas flow through rocket nozzles, and predict the accompanying heat flux into nozzle walls • Ablative cooling in thrust chambers of liquid rocket engine with material recession, along with the associated film cooling by the pyrolyzed gases. Expected Deliverables are: Validated parallelized numerical tool that can simultaneously estimate the heating of chamber walls of liquid rocket engines and simulate the performance of ablative cooling methodology with radiation."},

    {"input": "tell me about Heat sink integrated X- band microstrip antenna array", "reference": "High power active phased arrays are widely used in various satellite based synthetic Aperture RADARs and ground based RADARs. In an active phased array confi guration, each antenna element is equipped with a power amplifi er module and these distributed amplifi ers produce large amount of heat. This would lead to thermal run away in amplifi er modules and affect the performance of both transmitter and receiver modules. 9 VIKRAM SARABHAI SPACE CENTRE A possible solution is to add heat sinks on the microwave circuit side of the PCB, at the cost of increased real estate and possible EMI problems while encapsulating the entire system. In normal sense the electromagnetic radiation from heat sinks is typically undesirable and should be minimized to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). However it can be advantageous to maximize the radiation from a heat sink by using the antenna as a heat sink. In microstrip antennas the radiation structure can be modifi ed as heat sinks by providing proper heat routing strategies. The introduction of heat sinks should not affect the radiation and refl ection characteristics of the antenna. The proposals are invited to develop a heat sink integrated microstrip antenna confi gurations suitable for X-band phased arrays. Antenna should operate in 10GHz band with dual linear polarization."},
