Its primary objective is to study the Sun from a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system. The mission carries seven payloads, five developed by ISRO and two by Indian academic institutes in collaboration with ISRO, to observe the photosphere, chromosphere, and the outermost layers of the Sun (the corona). This will provide a greater advantage of observing solar activities continuously without occultation/eclipses.",
